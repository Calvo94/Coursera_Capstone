Actually I'm a data engineer, I do some ingestion and transformation but I'm aiming to become a data scientist. Because I see Data science as the art of making a usefull story from data."

Having a neighborhood doesn’t mean that you can know it’s city, and this is the major question we’re going to ask. Can we predict the city of a neighborhood based on its avenues?\n",
